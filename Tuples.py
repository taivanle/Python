#Tuples

#Tuple is a type of data structure/container that can store different values
#very similar to lists, allows us to store multiple pieces of information, but very big key differences

#most  common tuples is coordinates

#coordinates = (4, 5)
#coordinates[1] = 10
coordinates = [(4, 5), (6, 7), (8, 9)]

#tuples are imutable, cannot be changed or modified at all!!!

#tuples are indexed starting at 0
print(coordinates)
#should print out 4

#if we try to change one of the elements in coordinates, it will give us an error because it is immutable (coordinates[1] = 10)

#REMEMBER WHEN MAKING A LIST USE [] NOT () people use tuples for data that will never change, like coordinates.
#you can create a list of tuples!!
