#Getting input form users
#we are going to allow a user to input information into our program and we will take that information and store it within a variable

#input() tells python we want the user to input something
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
#to store what the user inputs as a variable we need to set the variable to be equal to input()
#name is now a variable container
print("Hello " + name + "! You are " + age + ".")
